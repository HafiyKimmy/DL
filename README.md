# DIgital Logic

This course introduces the basics of digital electronics used in systems such as computers, robots, and industrial controls. Students learn about number systems, logic gates, Boolean algebra, and basic digital circuits like flip-flops, counters, and registers. Learning includes lectures, tutorials, and hands-on lab work using simulation software. By the end of the course, students can design and test simple digital circuits and apply digital logic to solve practical problems.
