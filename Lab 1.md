# Lab 1

This lab was interesting because it allowed me to build and test logic circuits using the ETS-5000 Digital Training System and basic logic gates such as AND, OR, and NOT. I learned how to use ICs like 7408, 7432, and 7404 to construct circuits, including combining gates to form an XOR gate, and how to use switches, LEDs, and probes to test the circuit. The lab also improved my testing and debugging skills, as I learned how to check connections and identify mistakes when the results did not match the theory. Overall, this lab helped me understand how theoretical concepts work in real hardware and taught me the importance of being careful, as small errors can affect the entire circuit.
